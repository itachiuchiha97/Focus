We can run node in Chrome as well (Dev tools> console), this is like we run in terminal

Everything we create rests inside 'window' {javascript}

Whereas in node it is called 'global'
got 'process' to do things example process.close(0) // to exit node



in i/o operation { //taking input vagehra
blocking;
machine waits for the server to do something and do not do anything else unless one task is completed
use threads (resource wastage)

 vs non blocking i/o(node use this)
 kicks off all wevents at once unlike pele wala. Does not make process faster but enables to run parallel hence entire finish faster
 also it does not use a seperate thread it just the way it works
}


modules are like libraries


//exports are usd to export functionality of one module to othe app.js

Use NPM for using online availaible vast databases
npm init // initializes the building process

LODASH kaafi bdia cheez hai 


NOTE: node-modules are not to be pushed as they may get updated;
plus point is if you've written it in package.json, I mean the dependencies then
just run > npm install
it will do Everything


NODEMON     reponsible for restarting app when something changes.

npm install asdasdasd -g // global install
npm install asdasdasd --save // specific project install
to activate run files as 
nodemon app.js

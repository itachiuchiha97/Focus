The goal of the electronics department is to performance tune the car using highly data driven approach and
bridging gap between simulations and practical scenarios.

Data Acquisition
The first requirement for any scientific claim to be acceptable is to be backed by some physical observations and measured data.
We developed a custom DAQ system comprising of microcontrollers and a processing unit enabling us to interface sensors 
of different protocols including SPI, I2C, UART and CANBUS. 

Sensor          Use

GNSS - to locate the vehicle in space and generate track map
IR sensors - to find ride height of car
IMU - to get acceleration, roll, pitch and yaw angles
Temperature sensors - to get Tyre Temperature
Linear potentiometers - to get travel of dampers
Rotary potentiometer - to get steering angle
Engine sensors - to 
Servos - to position various actors at a particular angles

A significant amount of time is given in developing a reliable and fast DAQ system with structured data.
An open source software MongoDB has been used in creating the database.

Interactive Screen
It is used to display critical vehicle parameters; including engine sensors, status of various actors
and allows to set up the vehicle for different race modes.

Telemetry
An on-board Transmitter with high gain Antenna has been put up to wirelessly transmit vehicle data to pits
in real time allowing the second driver to find those extra tenths in given conditions by analyzing and setting
up vehicle for next run.

Controls


in vehicle for validation and facilitating driver with user friendly controls
to simplify drivability which includes interfacing sensors of different protocols together on single place at same time. 

Transmitter and Antenna - 

At the heart of this lies a processing unit which acts as a


that includes for instance, dynamic actuation of drag reduction system, actuating the shifter perfectly every time using PID control

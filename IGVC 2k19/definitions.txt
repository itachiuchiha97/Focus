COMMON CONTROLS:
Common Controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability 
that is inheritable by multiple information systems (IS).

agency information security officer; developing and maintaining security policies, procedures,
and control techniques to address security requirements; overseeing personnel with significant
responsibilities for security and ensuring that the personnel are adequately trained;

agency is achieved through the management of the agencyâ€™s acquisition activities. 

ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE:
An enterprise architecture (EA) is a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of an 
organization. 
The intent of an enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can most effectively achieve 
its current and future objectives.

ENTERPRISE ARCHITECT:

solutions;
Coordinate with security and privacy architects to determine the optimal placement of
systems/system elements within the enterprise architecture and to address security and

COMMON CRITERIA EVALUATION
The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CC), and the companion Common Methodology
for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CEM) are the technical basis for an international agreement,
the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA), which ensures that:

Products can be evaluated by competent and independent licensed laboratories so as to determine the fulfilment 
of particular security properties, to a certain extent or assurance;
Supporting documents, are used within the Common Criteria certification process to define how the criteria and 
evaluation methods are applied when certifying specific technologies;
The certification of the security properties of an evaluated product can be issued by a number of 
Certificate Authorizing Schemes, with this certification being based on the result of their evaluation;
These certificates are recognized by all the signatories of the CCRA.
The addendum does not change or influence the initial assessor findings provided in the reports. Information
provided in the addendum is considered by authorizing officials when making risk-based authorization
decisions.

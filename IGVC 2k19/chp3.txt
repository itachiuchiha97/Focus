The best RMF implementation is one that is indistinguishable from the routine SDLC processes //SEE SPIRAL MODEL OF SDLC
carried out by organizations.Organizations align their risk management roles with complementary or similar 
roles defined for the SDLC whenever possible, and consistent with missions and business functions.

While the tasks appear in sequential order, there can be many points in the risk management process that
require divergence from the sequential order, including the need for iterative cycles between
initial task execution and revisiting tasks.
Regardless of the task ordering, the final action before a system is placed into operation is the explicit
acceptance of risk by the authorizing official.

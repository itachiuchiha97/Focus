Cyber Challenge:

Understanding NIST RMF process 

Understanding of the NIST RMF
process will be demonstrated by a written report describing the process in general, followed by a specific
case study using either a provided or novel threat concept applied to a specific vehicle

presentation will be delivered during the IGVC competition and will demonstrate team understanding of
the NIST RMF process as well as how it was applied to the choice, design, and implementation of cyber
controls for team robots specific to chosen threat scenario

Design report complete new for task?

 required to submit an electronic copy in PDF format along with a scanned copy
of the statement in PDF format by May 17, 2019.

The technical presentation should relate the highlights of the written report described above and
include any updates of the design since the written report
 
Audio or video presentations of the text are not allowed, but graphic aids may be presented by video, slide projection, computer projection, overhead
transparencies, or easel charts. 

 A penalty of 5 points will be assessed for each minute or fraction thereof over 11 minutes. After
the presentation, judges only may ask questions for up to 5 minutes
 The audience should be considered
as a senior management group of generally knowledgeable engineers upon whom the project is
dependent for funding and the team is dependent for their employment.

(block diagrams rather than detailed circuit diagrams)
not reading notes or screen or looking above audience heads
 Response to questions means
short answers that address only the question

Participants are responsible for providing their own visual aids and related equipment (the vehicle
itself may be displayed). A computer-connected projector will be made available. Projectors may also be
supplied by the participants.

During the oral presentation, the following question period and the examination of the vehicle,
team members sitting the audience may participate by assisting the oral presenters, but at no time is the
faculty advisor to participate in this part of the design competition

 Cyber Controls Audit
The vehicle must be present (presentation not more than 40min)

The burden of proof for the efficacy of the implemented
controls lies with the student groups and should be fully explained in the written report and oral
presentation.

NIST RMF process has 7 steps:

1. Prepare
2. Categorize
3. Select
4. Implement
5. Assess
6. Authorize
7. Monitor


*PREPARE* //Roles wali bakchodi to be addeds
    to carry out "essential activities" at organization mission and bussiness process and information system
    levels

TP1. Identify and assign roles
    INPUTS: Security privacy policy and procedures, organization charts
    OUTPUTS: Documented RMF role assignments

TP2. Risk Management Strategy
    INPUTS:mission statements, policies, risk assumptions, constraints, priorities, tradeoffs
    OUTPUTS:rm Strategy and statements of risk tolerance inclusive of info security and privacy risk
 Risk tolerance is the degree of risk or uncertainty that is acceptable to an organization.
 Guides and informs risk-based decisions including how security and privacy risk is framed, assessed, responded to, and
 monitored.

 TP3. Risk Assessment
    INPUTS:memoranda of understanding, security and privacy information from continuous monitoring.
    OUTPUTS:risk assessment results.

      Step 1: Identify hazards, i.e. anything that may cause harm.
      Step 2: Decide who may be harmed, and how.
      Step 3: Assess the risks and take action.
      Step 4: Make a record of the findings.
      Step 4: Make a record of the findings.

 TP4. Organizationally-Tailored Control Baselines //optional
    INPUTS: Documented security and privacy requirements tailored to a particular organization.
    OUTPUTS: enterprise architecture, //An enterprise architecture (EA) is a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of an organization. The intent of an enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can most effectively achieve its current and future objectives. 
             security architecture,
             privacy architecture.

COMMON CONTROL IDENTIFICATION //Common controls can be any type of security control or protective measures used to meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your information system.
TP5. Identify, document, and publish organization wide used common controls that are available for inheritance
     by organizational system
     INPUTS:Documented security and privacy requirements
            existing common control providers and
            associated security and privacy plans
            information security and privacy program plans
            organization- and system-level security and privacy risk assessment results.
     OUTPUTS:List of common control providers
             and common controls available for inheritance?
 Common Controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability 
 that is inheritable  by multiple information systems (IS). 
 For example, the information systems hosted in a data center will typically inherit numerous security 
 controls from the hosting provider, such as:
    -Physical and environmental security controls
    -Network boundary defense security controls
 shared services, specific
 systems, or within a specific type of architecture
 for instance, camera input information is passed through some xyz firewalls now when some new person access
 camera data then prev controls stay in place.

TP6: Categorize wrt level of impact of threat on system.

TP7. Strategy for continuously monitoring control effectiveness.
    INPUTS:Risk management strategy,
           risk assessment results,
           security and privacy policies


RMF ALIGNMENT WITH THE SDLC
The best RMF implementation is one that is indistinguishable from the routine SDLC processes
carried out by organizations. That is, RMF tasks are closely aligned with the ongoing activities in
the SDLC processes, ensuring the seamless integration of security and privacy protections into
organizational systemsâ€”and taking maximum advantage of the artifacts generated by the SDLC
processes to produce the necessary evidence in authorization packages to facilitate credible,
risk-based decision making by senior leaders in organizations.

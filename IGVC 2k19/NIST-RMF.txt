    INPUTS: Documented security and privacy requirements tailored to a particular organization.
    OUTPUTS: enterprise architecture, //An enterprise architecture (EA) is a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of an organization. The intent of an enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can most effectively achieve its current and future objectives. 
             security architecture,
             privacy architecture.

COMMON CONTROL IDENTIFICATION //Common controls can be any type of security control or protective measures used to meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your information system.
TP5. Identify, document, and publish organization wide used common controls that are available for inheritance
     by organizational system
     INPUTS:Documented security and privacy requirements
            existing common control providers and
            associated security and privacy plans
            information security and privacy program plans
            organization- and system-level security and privacy risk assessment results.
     OUTPUTS:List of common control providers
             and common controls available for inheritance?
 Common Controls are security controls whose implementation results in a security capability 
 that is inheritable  by multiple information systems (IS). 
 For example, the information systems hosted in a data center will typically inherit numerous security 
 controls from the hosting provider, such as:
    -Physical and environmental security controls
    -Network boundary defense security controls
 shared services, specific
 systems, or within a specific type of architecture
 for instance, camera input information is passed through some xyz firewalls now when some new person access
 camera data then prev controls stay in place.

TP7. Strategy for continuously monitoring control effectiveness.
    INPUTS:Risk management strategy,
           risk assessment results,
           security and privacy policies


RMF ALIGNMENT WITH THE SDLC
The best RMF implementation is one that is indistinguishable from the routine SDLC processes
carried out by organizations. That is, RMF tasks are closely aligned with the ongoing activities in
the SDLC processes, ensuring the seamless integration of security and privacy protections into
organizational systems—and taking maximum advantage of the artifacts generated by the SDLC
processes to produce the necessary evidence in authorization packages to facilitate credible,
risk-based decision making by senior leaders in organizations.

        TC3. SECURITY CATEGORIZATION REVIEW AND APPROVAL
            INPUTS: Identification of above processes
            OUTPUTS: Approval of security CATEGORIZATION



SELECT:purpose of the Select step is to select, tailor, and document the controls necessary to protect
       the information system and organization commensurate with risk to organizational operations
        and assets, individuals, other organizacd tions, and the Nation.

        TS1. Select controls for system and environment of operation
            INPUTS: Above points result ie., categorize and preparse step,
                    Cybersecurity Framework Profiles.
            OUTPUTS: selection of controls
            two approaches- a baseline control selection approach, or an organization-generated control 
            selection approach.
            In both the baseline control selection approach and organization-generated control selection approachh
            organizations develop a well-defined set of security and privacy requirements using a life cycle-based
            systems engineering process.
        
       TS2. Tailor the controls selected for the system and the environment of operation.
            INPUTS: All assessed risks and requirements
            OUTPUTS: Control tailoring
        the justification or supporting rationale for scoping decisions related to a high-
        impact system or high value asset

        TS3. Control Allocation 

            OUTPUTS: • Controls are designated as system-specific, hybrid, or common controls.
                     • Controls are allocated to the specific system elements (i.e.,
                       machine, physical, or human elements).
        Not all controls need to be allocated by all system elements
        Controls providing a specific security or privacy capability are only allocated to system elements 
        that require that capability.
        example: system-specific controls associated with management of audit logs may be allocated to a log 
        management server and need not be implemented on every system element

        TS4. Document the controls for the system and environment of operation in security and privacy plans.

            Documentation of planned control implementations allows for traceability of decisions prior to and after
            the deployment of the system. To the extent possible, organizations reference existing documentation
            (either by vendors or other organizations that have employed the same or similar systems or system
            elements), use automated support tools, and coordinate across the organization to reduce redundancy
            and increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of control documentation        
            Also, addresses platform dependencies and includes any additional information necessary to describe how 
            the capability required is to be achieved at the level of detail sufficient to support control implementation and
            assessment.
            In some cases security controls can be implemented in ways that create privacy risks. 
            The privacy program supports documentation of privacy risk considerations and the implementations intended to mitigate them.
            Documenting the process helps to ensure traceability in meeting the security and privacy requirements.

        TS5. CONTINUOUS MONITORING STRATEGY — SYSTEM
                Continuous monitoring strategy for the system including time-based trigger for ongoing authorization
        An important aspect of risk management is the ongoing monitoring of controls implemented
        within or inherited by an information system. An effective continuous monitoring strategy at the system
        level is developed and implemented in coordination with the organizational continuous monitoring
        strategy early in the SDLC (i.e., during initial system design or procurement decision)
        the system-level continuous monitoring strategy identifies the criteria for determining the frequency with which
        controls are monitored post-implementation and the plan for the ongoing assessment of those controls.
        The Privacy Continuous Monitoring (PCM) strategy includes all of the available privacy controls implemented
        ughout the organization at all risk management levels (i.e., organization, mission/business process, and system).
        The strategy ensures that the controls are monitored on an ongoing basis by assigning an organization-defined
        assessment frequency to each control that is sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements
        and to manage privacy risks.

        TS6. Review and approve the security and privacy plans for the system and the environment of
             operation.
         INPUTS: Security and privacy plans; organization- and system-level risk assessment results.
         OUTPUTS: Security and privacy plans approved by the authorizing official.
              TO CHECK  if the plans are complete, consistent, and satisfy the stated security and privacy requirements
              for the system.



IMPLEMENT:
    Purpose is to implement the controls in security and privacy plans for system and to
    document specific details of control implementation.

TI.1 CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION

     OUTPUTS:Controls specified in the security and privacy plans are implemented
             Systems security and privacy engineering methodologies are used to implement the controls in
             the system security and privacy plans.
             in commercial off-the-shelf products, organizations
            consider the use of system elements that have been tested, evaluated, or validated by approved,
            independent, third-party assessment facilities (e.g., NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program
            Testing Laboratories, National Information Assurance Partnership Common Criteria Testing Laboratories).
            The tests, evaluations, and validations consider products in specific configurations and in isolation; control                implementation addresses how the product is integrated into the system while preserving security
            functionality and assurance

TI.2 UPDATE CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION
      OUTPUTS: Changes to the planned implementation of controls are documented.
               The security and privacy plans are updated based on information
               obtained during the implementation of the controls;
    The updates include revised descriptions of implemented controls including
    changes to planned inputs, expected behavior, and expected outputs with sufficient detail to support
    control assessments. Documenting the “as implemented” control information is essential to providing the
    capability to determine when there are changes to the controls, whether those changes are authorized,
    and the impact of the changes on the security and privacy posture of the system and the organization.



ASSESS:
    to determine if controls selected for implementation are implemented correctly, operating as intended
    and producing desired outcome wrt meeting security and privacy.

     TA.1 ASSESOR SELECTION
       INPUTS:Security, privacy, and SCRM plan, program management control information, common control                   documentation, security and privacy program plans,
                  system design documentation; enterprise, security, and privacy architecture informaton; 
                  security, privacy, and SCRM policies and procedures applicable to the system.
           OUTPUTS: an assessor or assessment team is selected to conduct control assessments 

     TA.2 ASSESSMENT PLAN
        Develop, review, and approve plans to assess implemented controls.
         INPUTS: As above
         OUTPUTS:Documentation needed to conduct the assessments is provided to the assessor or assessment team.
                  Security and privacy assessment plans are developed and documented.
                  Security and privacy assessment plans are reviewed and
                  approved to establish the expectations for the control assessments and the level of effort required.
                  employ procedures, methods, techniques, tools, and automation to support continuous monitoring and near 
                  real-time risk management; and are cost-effective.
         example:
            developmental testing and evaluation; independent verification and validation; audits, including supply
            chain; assessments supporting system and common control authorization or reauthorization; program           
            management control assessments; continuous monitoring; and assessments conducted after remediation
            actions.

     TA.3 CONTROL ASSESSMENT
       Assess the controls in accordance with the assessment procedures described in assessment plans.
          OUTPUTS:Control assessments are conducted in accordance with the security and privacy assessment plans
                 Opportunities to reuse assessment results from previous assessments to make the risk management
                 process timely and cost-effective are considered.
                 Use of automation to conduct control assessments is maximized to increase speed, effectiveness,
                 and efficiency of assessments.
                 Control assessments occur as early as practicable in the SDLC, preferably during the development phase.
                 Organizations can maximize the use of automation to conduct control assessments to increase the speed,effectiveness,
                 and efficiency of the assessments, and to support continuous monitoring of the security and privacy
                 posture of organizational systems. 

          example: design and code reviews, regression testing, and application scanning.                  
                A recent audit of a system may have produced information about the effectiveness of selected controls. 
                Another opportunity to reuse previous assessment results may come from external programs that test and evaluate security and
                privacy features of commercial information technology products (e.g., Common Criteria Evaluation and
                Validation Program and NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program,). If prior assessment results from
                the system developer or vendor are available, the control assessor, under appropriate circumstances, may
                incorporate those results into the assessment.
                if a control implementation was assessed during other forms of assessment at previous stages of the 
                SDLC (e.g., unit testing, functional testing,acceptance testing), organizations may consider potential reuse 
                of those results to reduce duplication of efforts

                //SEE APPENDIX F FOR "AUTHORIZATION BAKCHODI"


        TA.4 ASSESSMENT REPORTS
        Security and privacy assessment reports that provide findings and recommendations are completed.
        
 example:
    developmental testing and evaluation; independent verification and
    validation; independent assessments supporting information system or common control authorizations or
    reauthorizations; self-assessments; assessments after remediation actions; independent evaluations or
    audits; and assessments during continuous monitoring.


REMEDIATION ACTIONS:
    To remediate is to correct or make right.
    to address deficiencies in the controls implemented in the system and environment of operation are
    taken.
    Security and privacy plans are updated to reflect control implementation changes made based on the 
    assessments and subsequent remediation actions.
    INPUTS: Completed security and privacy assessment reports with findings and
    recommendations; security and privacy plans; security and privacy assessment plans; organization- and
    System-level risk assessment results.

     not be resolved during the development of the system or that are discovered post-development


TA.6 PLAN OF ACTION AND MILESTONES
    Prepare the plan of action and milestones based on the findings and recommendations of the
    assessment reports.
    A plan of action and milestones detailing remediation plans for
    unacceptable risks identified in security and privacy assessment

Everything in Java is a class
And every class should have a main method.

Not a compulsion to have java file name same as class name.
For instance if xyz is file name and xyz12 is class name then the compiled class name will be xyz12
But when class is public then it should have same name as file

source code > compiler > bytecode
java api has all the classes (default) needed for execution. It can be imported during use example Scanner class for taking input

//firse save a file name.java 
javac name.java //compiles and gives a bytecode as name.class it is unreadable also known as Object Code it is defined as output of compiled Code
java name // runs the bytecode using JVM (platform independent)
